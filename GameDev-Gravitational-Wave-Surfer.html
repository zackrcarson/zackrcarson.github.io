            <h2>Personal Game Development Demo: Block Breaker</h2>

<p>
You are a Hydrogen atom alone in the depths of intergalactic space. Various particles and antiparticles begin popping into existence around you, as you notice a binary black hole merger in progress in the distance. Suddenly you feel the gravitational radiation hit you, stretching and squeezing the spacetime around you. Can you build yourself into heavier, more complex elements while navigating this warping spacetime? Tread lightly though - if your atomic isotope becomes unstable, it's all over for you! I hope you enjoy this educational outreach game, designed to teach students about general relativity and gravitational waves. This game was developed by me in collaboration with Professor Kent Yagi (University of Virginia) under an NSF outreach grant. Future versions of it (including 3D gaming!) will continue to be developed by University of Virginia undergraduate students, in collaboration under the same grant. The repository for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson/GravitationalWaveSurfer">here.</a>.
