            <h2>Personal Game Development Demo: Robot Revolution</h2>

<p>
You're enjoying a peaceful day on your remote island-village when you see a strange machine flying towards you from the distance... It's the robot invaders! They're coming to destroy human life as you know it! Quickly now - deploy your mage towers and rain down fire on your mortal enemies. Don't let them into your village - they're heavily armed with explosives and they WILL bring you down under the water! However, you must be careful as we only have so many mage towers at your disposal. If you use too many, the first one you constructed must be taken down to accomodate the new one! So think carefully where you place your towers! This game was a lot of fun to work on, and I spent a lot of time creating cool animations and particle effects, building my own pathfinding algorithms (as well as ring-queues, nearest-enemy-tower-following, and more) finding good assets, making in-editor level-building tools, and creating a well-rounded demo. See if you can beat both levels! Also make sure to check out the dramatic death scenes. The repository for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson/Unity3DGames">here.</a>
