            <h2>Personal Game Development Demo: Lost In Space</h2>

<p>
A strange alien species has taken over your space freighter on its way back from Alpha Centauri. Before you know it, you are the last surviving human being on this broken down ship, stranded in the middle of space. To make matters worse, hundreds - if not thousands - of clicking alien creatures are inhabiting your ship, hunting you down! Most of the lights are out, and your flashlight keeps on dying.. But you have a plan! If only you can make it to the main control room! There you can turn the lights back on, shut the control room pressurized door, and vent the rest of the ship, sending the aliens out into the cold confines of space! But then you'll be alone for the rest of your life, because you have no idea how to fix the ship.. This project was heavily inspired by one of my favorite dames - Dead Space - and I had a lot of fun creating it. Here, I spent a lot of time finding good enemies, environment, and prop assets to add to my world, creating spooky lighting and sound effects throughout the freighter, adding interesting pickups and weapons (try shooting a wall with each weapon!), and creating lots of animations. Try it out, explore the spaceship, check out all four weapons, see the death scene, and try to reach the end where a fun cutscene kills all of the aliens on the ship! The controls can be found from the start screen, or on the pause menu. The repository for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson/Unity3DGames">here.</a> Click the thumbnail below to play the game! Apologies for the somewhat glitchy audio tracks and mouse sensitivity occurring in the WebGL build!.
