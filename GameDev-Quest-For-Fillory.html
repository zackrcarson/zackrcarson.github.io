            <h2>Personal Game Development Demo: Quest For Fillory</h2>

<p>
You've woken up in a strange, beautiful land next to an old wooden tree trunk. The trunk starts to move! And.. it's your best friend Elliot? You have no idea what happened the night before, but the last thing you remember was practicing magic in your dorm.. And is that Poppy you see over there? You better go talk to her and see what's going on before those strange looking creatures you see in the distance get too friendly. This game was inspired by many of my favorite RPG games of the past, and of course my favorite book and TV show "The Magicians". This game was one of the largest I've made to date, and I spent many many hours designing, quest-building, finding/creating audio for every little thing, and building lots of gameplay mechanics including battle, magic, stats, equipment, potions, shops, NPCs (with talking effects!), quests, save/load systems, and more! Enjoy the game, and try to survive the entire main quest line - but make sure to save often (P.S. saved game files should persist on your browser as long as the cache isn't cleared)! The repository for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson/QuestForFillory">here.</a>
