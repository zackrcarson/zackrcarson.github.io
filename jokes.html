            <h2>Time for some Humor</h2>
            <h3>The Conductor</h3>
<p>
Bob was one of the worst train conductors to ever live. He was late to work every day, he never followed instructions properly, he went too fast, and never slowed down.
One late autumn afternoon, Bob rounded a corner near town a little too fast, and de-railed the train, crushing multiple cars and ending multiple innocent lives.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Bob was arrested, and given the death sentence for manslaughter.

<p>
Now, come the day of the big execution, the police ask Bob: "What would you like for your last meal?" to which he would reply: "I'll take a green banana please!" They gave him a green banana, which he gratefully devoured before being strapped into the chair. The town watched as the executioner pulled the lever, zapping poor Bob to death. 
</p>

<p>
But.. a few seconds later Bob opened his eyes - apparently unaffected by the shock! The whole town in dismay, they put Bob back in jail as their top engineers check and test the electric chair. A few weeks later, they repeat the whole ordeal: asking Bob what he'd want for his last meal, to which he'd reply "a green banana please!" He then ate the banana, got strapped down into the chair, and shocked a second time. Lo behold - he survived again without a scratch!
</p>

<p>
This time, the town is concerned - and the entire city council convenes for a meeting. The priest raises concern that this may be divine intervention - if the shock fails a third time, it must be a sign from God! He must be released at once.
</p>

<p>
So, a week later they try shocking Bob for a third time. Once again he asks for a green banana, and once again the shock failed to hurt him.
</p>

<pa>
The town finally gives up, and lets Bob walk. Outside, an eager reporter asks: "Bob, how did you do it? It must be that green banana! How did it save you so many times?" to which Bob shrugs and replies:
</p>

<p>
"I just like green bananas! I guess I'm just a bad conductor!"

        <h3>The Rabbit's Thesis</h3>
        
<p>It's a fine sunny day in the forest; and a rabbit is sitting outside his burrow, tippy-tapping on his lap top. Along comes a fox, out for a walk.</p>

<p><b>Fox:</b> "What are you working on?" <b>Rabbit:</b> "My thesis." <b>Fox:</b> "Hmmmmm. What is it about?" <b>Rabbit:</b> "Oh, I'm writing about how rabbits eat foxes."</p>

<p><i>(incredulous pause)</i> <b>Fox:</b> "That's ridiculous! Any fool knows that rabbits don't eat foxes!" <b>Rabbit:</b> "Come with me and I'll show you!"</p>

<p>They both disappear into the rabbit's burrow. After a few minutes, gnawing on a fox bone, the rabbit returns to his lap top and resumes typing.</p>

<p>Soon a wolf comes along and stops to watch the hard working rabbit.</p>

<p><i>(Tippy-tap, tippy-tap, tippy-tippy-tap).</i></p>

<p><b>Wolf:</b> "What's that you are writing?" <b>Rabbit:</b> "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat wolves."</p>

<p><i>(loud guffaws)</i>. <b>Wolf:</b> "You don't expect to get such rubbish published, do you?" <b>Rabbit:</b> "No problem. Do you want to see why?"</p>

<p>The rabbit and the wolf go into the burrow, and again the rabbit returns by himself. This time he is patting his stomach. He goes back to his typing.</p>

<p><i>(Tippy-tap, tippy-tap, tippy-tippy-tap).</i></p>

<p>Finally a bear comes along and asks, "What are you doing?"</p>

<p><b>Rabbit:</b> "I'm doing a thesis on how rabbits eat bears." <b>Bear:</b> "Well that's absurd!" <b>Rabbit:</b> "Come into my home and I'll show you."</p>

<p>Inside the rabbit's burrow. In one corner, there is a pile of fox bones. In another corner is a pile of wolf bones. On the other side of the room a huge lion is belching and picking his teeth.</p>

<p><b>MORAL:</b> It doesn't matter what you choose for a thesis topic. It doesn't matter what you use for your data. It doesn't even matter if your topic makes sense. What matters is who you have for a thesis advisor.</p>
