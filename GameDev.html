            <h2>Personal Game Development Demos</h2>
<p>
Below you can see and play with some of the game development demos I have been working on in my spare time. The full games are all still works in progress, but they are completely playable as demos, and lots of fun to develop and play! Source code for the following games can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson?tab=repositories">Game Development GitHub repository found here</a>. Click on any of the thumbnails below to play the games yourself! Apologies in advance for any lags present in some of the games due to the Unity WebGL build which allows us to play the games here. Alternatively see my <a href="https://simmer.io/@zcarson">SIMMER.io profile</a> to play the games.

 <h3>Quest For Fillory</h3>
<p>
You've woken up in a strange, beautiful land next to an old wooden tree trunk. The trunk starts to move! And.. it's your best friend Elliot? You have no idea what happened the night before, but the last thing you remember was practicing magic in your dorm.. And is that Poppy you see over there? You better go talk to her and see what's going on before those strange looking creatures you see in the distance get too friendly. This game was inspired by many of my favorite RPG games of the past, and of course my favorite book and TV show "The Magicians". This game was one of the largest I've made to date, and I spent many many hours designing, quest-building, finding/creating audio for every little thing, and building lots of gameplay mechanics including battle, magic, stats, equipment, potions, shops, NPCs (with talking effects!), quests, save/load systems, and more! Enjoy the game, and try to survive the entire main quest line - but make sure to save often (P.S. saved game files should persist on your browser as long as the cache isn't cleared)!

 <h3>Lost In Space</h3>
<p>
A strange alien species has taken over your space freighter on its way back from Alpha Centauri. Before you know it, you are the last surviving human being on this broken down ship, stranded in the middle of space. To make matters worse, hundreds - if not thousands - of clicking alien creatures are inhabiting your ship, hunting you down! Most of the lights are out, and your flashlight keeps on dying.. But you have a plan! If only you can make it to the main control room! There you can turn the lights back on, shut the control room pressurized door, and vent the rest of the ship, sending the aliens out into the cold confines of space! But then you'll be alone for the rest of your life, because you have no idea how to fix the ship.. This project was heavily inspired by one of my favorite dames - Dead Space - and I had a lot of fun creating it. Here, I spent a lot of time finding good enemies, environment, and prop assets to add to my world, creating spooky lighting and sound effects throughout the freighter, adding interesting pickups and weapons (try shooting a wall with each weapon!), and creating lots of animations. Try it out, explore the spaceship, check out all four weapons, see the death scene, and try to reach the end where a fun cutscene kills all of the aliens on the ship! The controls can be found from the start screen, or on the pause menu. The repository for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson/Unity3DGames">here.</a> Click the thumbnail below to play the game! Apologies for the somewhat glitchy audio tracks and mouse sensitivity occurring in the WebGL build!.

 <h3>Robot Revolution</h3>
<p>
You're enjoying a peaceful day on your remote island-village when you see a strange machine flying towards you from the distance... It's the robot invaders! They're coming to destroy human life as you know it! Quickly now - deploy your mage towers and rain down fire on your mortal enemies. Don't let them into your village - they're heavily armed with explosives and they WILL bring you down under the water! However, you must be careful as we only have so many mage towers at your disposal. If you use too many, the first one you constructed must be taken down to accomodate the new one! So think carefully where you place your towers! This game was a lot of fun to work on, and I spent a lot of time creating cool animations and particle effects, building my own pathfinding algorithms (as well as ring-queues, nearest-enemy-tower-following, and more) finding good assets, making in-editor level-building tools, and creating a well-rounded demo. See if you can beat both levels! Also make sure to check out the dramatic death scenes.

 <h3>Candy Castle</h3>
<p>
This was a really fun platformer project I spent a long time finding sprites, and fine tuning/adding lots of cool features, including character customization, a boss level, animations, sound effects, and more. Try to beat the game by getting past the 4th level! Apologies for the lag present on Unity's WebGL  build of the game.

            <h3>The Doomed Planet</h3>
<p>
The entire system you're visiting is on the verge of destruction! Whatever dark entity you angered in the past has followed you here, with a vengence. Escape the planet while you still have time - but you need to find the fusion reactor before you can launch! And don't forget, this chaos has followers who will try to stop you at all costs! This was a fun game to make while exploring Unity3D, the terrain editor tools, and timelines. See if you can make it to the end and escape the planet!

            <h3>Crash Landing</h3>
<p>
Your intergalactic ship has been severely damaged, and you need to crash land on the nearest planet! In this demo you will need to navigate your ship through the treacherous atmosphere of Draxuter III, with only a limited amount of fuel remaining! Try to clear all 6 levels to finally land safely on the planet..  Use Space to enable your main thrusters, and A/D or left/right to rotate your ship with your RCS thrusters.

            <h3>The Farmer</h3>
<p>
This was a fun project I worked on similar to the popular game Stardew Valley. Try planting some crops (hit G to advance the game day quickly!), changing scenes (E to enter doors) breaking some rocks, following (Press T to advance the game time by 10 minutes!) or talking to  the NPC's (hit enter to talk), cutting down some trees, or customizing your character (ESC to see pause menu, with save/quit/load/volume/character customization tabs). Have fun! The repository for this game can be found <a href="https://github.com/zackrcarson/MyFarmingGame">here.</a> Click the thumbnail below to play the game!

            <h3>Laser Defender</h3>
<p>
Defend your planet! This top-down stile space shooter game was a blast to make, and even more fun to play! Move with 
"wasd" and shoot with your left mouse button. Hit ESC to pause the game, and make sure to pick up the pills to heal yourself (especially the red ones)! See if you can make it to the first boss before you die.. Good luck!
